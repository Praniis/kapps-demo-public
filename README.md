# Kapps Demo Application

## What is a KAPP

    KleverChain Apps (kapps) are on-chain applications developed by Klever Finance.

    KleverChain will offer pre-built and ready-to-use apps and functionality native to the blockchain, not merely a smart contracts platform. Developers will be able to implement their own interface solution through the Klever OS Software Development Kit (SDK).
